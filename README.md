# 🌐CollaboVis
The project CollaboVis primarily focuses on understanding the relationship between the growth of research communities and the diversity of topics over time. We will collect from online databases the publications of researchers of all universities in the Philippines from 1960 to 2020, create a weighted and temporal co-authorship network, and identify the communities for different time periods. Using the paper’s meta-data, topic modelling will be performed to identify research topics pursued individually by authors and collectively by communities. Following a network science approach, key researchers, and the growth and structure of the co-authorship network will be analyzed to characterize the Philippine scientific collaboration network. Then, preferential attachment will be extended to model how topic diversity influences the growth dynamics of research communities over time. Lastly, growing knowledge economies, and those that aspire to be, stand to benefit in improving the collaboration dynamics between researchers and in strengthening emerging communities.
